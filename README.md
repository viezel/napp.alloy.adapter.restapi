RestAPI Sync Adapter for Titanium Alloy Framework.


## How To Use

Simple add the following to your model in `PROJECT_FOLDER/app/models/`.

	exports.definition = {	
		config: {
			"URL": "http://example.com/api/modelname",
			"adapter": {
				"type": "restapi",
				"collection_name": "mymodelname"
			}
		},		
		extendModel: function(Model) {		
			_.extend(Model.prototype, {});
			return Model;
		},	
		extendCollection: function(Collection) {		
			_.extend(Collection.prototype, {});
			return Collection;
		}		
	}

Then add the `restapi.js` to `PROJECT_FOLDER/assets/alloy/sync/`. Create the folders if they dont exist.
